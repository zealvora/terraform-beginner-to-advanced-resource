</p>

This issue will be fixed soon by HashiCorp in the next versions of AWS provider.

Intermediate Solution to Resolve the Error:

1. Open the VPC Console in AWS through the following link:

   https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home

2. Click on "Your VPC"

3. There should be 1 default VPC with no name. Copy the VPC ID of this VPC.

4. Add the VPC ID in the vpc_id argument in the aws_security_group.

</p>

Here is a sample code reference:

```sh
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "kplabs-security-group"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-48ae592e"
```

Make sure to use the correct VPC ID of the AWS region in which you are creating your resource.

If you still get any error, feel free to raise your query in our Discord community. 

### Code:

```sh
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "PUT-YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE"
  secret_key = "PUT-YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
}



resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
   ami = "ami-082b5a644766e0e6f"
   instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
  vpc      = true
}

resource "aws_eip_association" "eip_assoc" {
  instance_id   = aws_instance.myec2.id
  allocation_id = aws_eip.lb.id
}


resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls" {
  name        = "kplabs-security-group"
  vpc_id      = <ADD-YOUR-VPC-ID-HERE>

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["${aws_eip.lb.public_ip}/32"]

   #cidr_blocks = [aws_eip.lb.public_ip/32]
  }
}
```
